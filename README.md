# Unreal Engine Fighting Demo

This project is a demo project using Unreal Engine. The project is a practice project where all the functions are implemented using C++. The emphasis on the project is to recreate a free-flow combat system similar to the Arkham series, if things permit, a more traditional combat system might be in scope as well. I have listed those functions separately, since I have made soem of them and might work on them as interchangeably.
