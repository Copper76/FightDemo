# Unreal Engine Fighting Demo

This project is a demo project using Unreal Engine. The project is a practice project where all the functions are implemented using C++. The emphasis on the project is to recreate a free-flow combat system similar to the Arkham series, if things permit, a more traditional combat system might be in scope as well.

## Functions implemented
- [x] Walking(Present)
- [x] Jumping(Present)
- [x] Dash to target, only do so if the target is in range and unobstructed
### traditional combat related
These are functions that work better for traditional combat, but do not work well with free-flow combat, I made them as I found them interesting, but they are not part of the free-flow experience
- [x] Target Lock on

## TODO
- [ ] Motion matching with animation
- [ ] Attack animation and effect
- [ ] Combo
- [ ] Enemy AI as a whole
- [ ] Dodging and Counter attack
### traditional combat related
- [ ] Traditional attack
- [ ] Heavy attack and combo
- [ ] Resilience and interrupt

## Controls
- WSAD to move around
- PRESS SPACE to jump
- PRESS SHIFT to dodge (not implemented)
- LMB to attack (not fully implemented)
- RMB to counter (not implemented)
### traditional combat related
- MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON to toggle locking
